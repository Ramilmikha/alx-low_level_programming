**Task 0: Print a String with Recursion**
In this task, you're asked to implement a function _puts_recursion that prints a string followed by a new line character
using recursion. The function takes a string as input and recursively prints each character until it reaches the end of the 
string.

**Task 1: Print a String in Reverse with Recursion**
This task requires you to implement a function _print_rev_recursion that prints a string in reverse using recursion. 
The function takes a string as input and recursively prints its characters in reverse order.

**Task 2: Calculate the Length of a String with Recursion**
In this task, you need to create a function _strlen_recursion that calculates and returns the length of a string using 
recursion. The function counts the characters in the string recursively until it reaches the end of the string.

**Task 3: Calculate the Factorial of a Number with Recursion**
You're asked to implement a function factorial that calculates and returns the factorial of a given number using recursion.
The factorial of a non-negative integer 'n' is the product of all positive integers from 1 to 'n'.

**Task 4: Calculate x to the Power of y with Recursion**
This task requires the implementation of _pow_recursion, a function that calculates and returns 'x' raised to the power
of 'y' using recursion. It computes 'x^y' recursively by multiplying 'x' 'y' times.

**Task 5: Calculate the Square Root of a Number with Recursion**
You're tasked with implementing _sqrt_recursion, a function that calculates and returns the natural square root of a number
using recursion. It finds the square root of 'n' recursively by checking values starting from 1.

**Task 6: Check if a Number is Prime with Recursion**
In this task, you need to create a function is_prime_number that checks whether a given number is prime or not using
recursion. It determines if 'n' is prime by recursively checking for divisors up to the square root of 'n'.
