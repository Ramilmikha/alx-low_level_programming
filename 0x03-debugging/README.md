Task 0 - Testing positive_or_negative():

Task 0 involves creating a test program to check the behavior of the positive_or_negative() function.
The program sets an integer variable i to 0 and then calls the positive_or_negative() function with i as an argument.
The expected output is to print "0 is zero" because 0 is neither positive nor negative.

Task 1 - Commenting out code:

Task 1 requires commenting out a portion of code in the given 1-main.c program.
The code in question contains a while loop that causes an infinite loop, and the task asks to comment out that loop while leaving the rest of the code intact.
The expected output is to print "Infinite loop incoming :(" followed by "Infinite loop avoided! \o/" without going into an actual infinite loop.

Task 2 - Fixing largest_number():

Task 2 involves fixing the largest_number() function, which is supposed to find the largest of three integers.
The provided code for largest_number() has a logical error causing it to produce incorrect results.
The task requires correcting the logic in largest_number() so that it correctly identifies and returns the largest of the three input integers.

Task 3 - Fixing leap year calculation:

Task 3 focuses on fixing the print_remaining_days() function, which calculates the remaining days in a year, considering leap years.
The provided code has issues with leap year calculation and date handling.
The task requires modifying the print_remaining_days() function to correctly handle leap years and different dates, ensuring it produces the correct output for a given date's day of the year and remaining days in the year.
